#' DIA-guidance: A package to infer protein abundance from DIA/SWATH-MS 
#' peptide measurements
#'
#' The DIA-guidance package contains functions to normalize peptide/fragment-level intensities, 
#' estimate protein abundances and conduct statistical tests on protein measurements. Although 
#' the package has primarily been developed for mass spectrometry proteomics (DIA/SWATH),
#' it should also be applicable to most proteomics data with minor adaptations.
